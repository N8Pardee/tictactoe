This tic tac toe project is a personal project where I will start with basic player input from the keyboard. Once that is working well, I will try to add a computer opponent and possibly a GUI 
if that goes well. I have this project broken into muliple classes and files in order to practice and get familiarity with OOP principles and styles.
